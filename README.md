MySchoolProjects

All of these code files are made for a school project in "Ohjelmointi 1" in a day, and earned me a score of 5/5 from the course.

Suurinluku.cpp

Calclulates the largest number from array provided by user, or another function, and returns the number to main function. Has next to no error recoverablility, nor anything fancy.

pupu.cpp

Calculates ammount of bunnies at generation inserted IF funnies reproduce at rate equal to fibbonachi sequense 

bensa.cpp

Kinda dumb calculator for differences between gallons and liters per distance traveled that was assainged as part of this assaingment, the code is so bad that i don't even want to refactor it, if you are here to evaluate my code, this is probably not the file to do that. It works, but it's not pretty, and does not match my capabilities.
