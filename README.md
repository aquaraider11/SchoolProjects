MySchoolProjects

All of these code files are made for a school project in "Ohjelmointi 1" in a day, and earned me a score of 5/5 from the course.

Suurinluku.cpp

Calclulates the largest number from array provided by user, or another function, and returns the number to main function. Has next to no error recoverablility, nor anything fancy.
